Resume Parsing Project using NER

This project is designed to parse and extract data from candidate resumes using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and other models such as QA and Summary. The goal of this project is to make it easier for 
recruiters and hiring managers to quickly and accurately extract relevant information from resumes.

How to use

To use this project, you will need to have Python and Spacy installed on your computer
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the parser on a resume file to extract information such as name, contact details, education, work experience, and skills.
The project uses transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the NER model. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on a specific task
In this case, the pre-trained model is a Spacy model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data. The model is then fine-tuned on a smaller corpus of resume data to improve its performance 
on the specific task of resume parsing.
